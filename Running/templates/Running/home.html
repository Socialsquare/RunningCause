<h4>Every step makes the world a little better</h4>
<p>Masanga Runners is not just a fun way to support a good project. It’s also a great way to make it easier to get in to your running shoes! With Masanga Runner, you can sponsor your running friends, but also get family and friends involved in your runs and the world’s best hospital project.</p>
<p>The idea behind Masanga Runners is that many runners and sponsors together can create a huge difference for the hospital in Masanga by running and donating small amounts.</p>
<p>”I am a Masanga Runner because it’s a form of motivation to get outside. As a Masanga Runner I know that it’s not just me getting something out of my runs,” says Søren Bo Steendahl, who has been a Masanga Runner since Fall 2014.</p>
<p>On this website, you can create an account by entering only a little information and become a part of the Masanga Runners community. You can invite your friends to sponsor you, share your page on social media, and make bets about your performance on runs – you’re only limited by your imagination! </p>
<h4>Tax Credits</h4>
<p>Masanga Hospital Rehabilitation Project is approved as a charitable organisation, so you can receive tax credits for your donations – all the way up to 15,000 kr. Masanga Runners sends out an email once a year to everyone who’s donated, asking them if they’re interested in the tax credits. You only need to provide your CPR number or you CVR number. It’s completely safe and secure.</p>
<h4>Sponsorship Termination</h4>
<p>You can end your sponsorships at any time, both as a runner and as a sponsor. You do this by clicking the ”end sponsorship” button by the relevant sponsorship. Both the runner and the sponsor will recieve an email with a confirmation.</p>
<h4>Masanga Runners t-shirt</h4>
<p>You can advertise your good work by buying a great Masanga Runners t-shirt here! It costs 250 kr, 50 of which go directly to Masanga. The rest goes to shipping, handling, and the t-shirt itself.</p>
<h4>Contact</h4>
<p>If you have any questions or comments regarding Masanga Runners, you’re welcome to contact Johanne Tofting Schaarup by email at masangarunners@masanga.dk, or by phone at +45 29 80 30 73.</p>
